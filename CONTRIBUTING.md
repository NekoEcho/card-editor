>Pour les francophones, le contenu de cette page est [également disponible en français](CONTRIBUTING-FR.md) ...

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Geckos. This project is open to everyone and every kind of contribution is greatly appreciated !

### About those guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What are we looking for ?

We are looking for any kind of feedback on Geckos.

It could be annoying bugs that you encountered, or lack of documentation on some functions. In this case, feel free to [create an Issue](https://github.com/gulix/geckos/issues/new) (or join an existing one) to express it. Please add screen captures, browser informations, and any kind of informations you have on your configuration : the more is the better in these cases.

Maybe you had an idea of something that could improve Geckos ? Hey, create an Issue about it, describe your idea, and we'll discuss it ! You can also join an existing discussion, and comment any Issue, by providing ideas, or even by just saying you thinks this is an important one.

Last, maybe you would like to add a new template, related to a game of your liking ? Well, in this case again, create an Issue about it. But keep in mind that Templates are not done by themselves, and it's time-consuming (and I've got templates of my own to create and maintain). I can also work on a template against a donation. Contact me to discuss about it.

### Helping making Geckos

Currently, Geckos is a one-man-project. If you want to participate in the creation of the software, well, you're welcome !

You're good in web-design and want to improve the UI of Geckos ? Propose your modifications ! Get the code and change it, a designated branch could be created to support this.

You want to add new templates ? Fork this project, add the new templates, create a pull request for those new templates, and they could appear in the next release !

You've got Javascript Superpowers and want to get to the core of Geckos ? As above, I accept Pull Requests !

You want to get Geckos in another language ? Well, right now, Geckos UI is not multi-language. But that could change ...
